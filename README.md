Simple Image Encryption Tool
This repository contains a simple image encryption tool built using Python. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel.

Features
Image Encryption: Encrypts images using pixel manipulation techniques.

Image Decryption: Decrypts previously encrypted images.

User-friendly: Simple and easy-to-use interface for image encryption and decryption.

How It Works
The tool performs operations on the pixel values of an image to encrypt and decrypt it. These operations include:

Swapping pixel values.

Applying a mathematical operation to each pixel value.
