Simple Image Encryption Tool
This repository contains a simple image encryption tool built using Python. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel.

Features
Image Encryption: Encrypts images using pixel manipulation techniques.

Image Decryption: Decrypts previously encrypted images.

User-friendly: Simple and easy-to-use interface for image encryption and decryption.

How It Works
The tool performs operations on the pixel values of an image to encrypt and decrypt it. These operations include:

Swapping pixel values.

Applying a mathematical operation to each pixel value.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Encryption-Tool.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash

Copy
cd Image-Encryption-Tool
Install the required dependencies:

bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Encrypt an Image:

python

Copy
from encrypt_decrypt import encrypt_image

encrypt_image('input_image.png', 'encrypted_image.png', key=50)
Decrypt an Image:

python

Copy
from encrypt_decrypt import decrypt_image

decrypt_image('encrypted_image.png', 'decrypted_image.png', key=50)
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the tool:

Encrypt an image:

python

Copy
from encrypt_decrypt import encrypt_image

encrypt_image('input_image.png', 'encrypted_image.png', key=50)
Decrypt the image:

python

Copy
from encrypt_decrypt import decrypt_image

decrypt_image('encrypted_image.png', 'decrypted_image.png', key=50)
